# Gene-Aging-Trends-Appyter
Trace changes in expression of human and mouse genes with age


***NOTE***
Appyter is NOT in final version yet. Still working on that right now but should have it by the end of today. 

***NOTE***
The LabWork.ipynb is a very rough version of the backend resource and contains alot of the data cleaning, EDA, and different methods to actually fit the data that I tried over the course of the project. A cleaner version will be added to the repo. Feel free to take a closer look but note that it may be somewhat difficult to go through as, again, it is a VERY rough draft of the actual backend resource.
